# Frontend Mentor challenges

## Description
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) is an online platform that provides front-end coding challenges to help developers improve their skills. The platform offers a wide range of project-based challenges that mimic real-world design and development tasks.
This repository contains in an organized manner my solutions to some of the challenges with the code and final result available for visualization. Some of the challenges have a little extra that I added (in an effort to practice CSS more) in a way that does not hurt the original design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Usage
- From the homepage you can navigate to any of the challenges and visualize the final result
